## Project Structure & Module Organization
CoPrintSlicer’s C++17 sources live in `src/`, split by feature modules and platform adapters. User assets, icons, and printer presets are in `resources/`; translations stay in `localization/`. Tests sit in `tests/`, grouped by domain (`libslic3r/`, `sla_print/`, etc.) with fixtures under `tests/data/`. CMake helpers reside in `cmake/`, and longer references in `doc/` and `SoftFever_doc/`. Automation scripts belong in `scripts/` and `tools/`. Treat everything in `deps/` and `deps_src/` as vendored snapshots—do not modify without mirroring upstream tags.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use out-of-source builds:
- `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` configures dependencies and generates build files.
- `cmake --build build --target CoPrintSlicer --config Release` compiles the app; add `--parallel` to speed up.
- `cmake --build build --target tests` then `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` runs automated suites.
Platform helpers such as `build_linux.sh`, `build_release_macos.sh`, and `build_release_vs2022.bat` wrap the same flow with toolchain flags. Use `build_release_macos.sh -sx` when reproducing macOS build issues, and `scripts/DockerBuild.sh` for reproducible container builds.

```bash
# macOS
cmake --build build/arm64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target all --

# Linux
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --target all --

# Windows (replace %build_type% with Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo)
cmake --build . --config %build_type% --target ALL_BUILD -- -m
```

## Testing

Catch2 framework. Tests in `tests/` directory.

```bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure           # all tests
ctest --test-dir ./tests/libslic3r              # individual suite
ctest --test-dir ./tests/fff_print
```

## Code Style

- C++17, selective C++20. PascalCase classes, snake_case functions/variables
- `#pragma once` for headers. Smart pointers and RAII preferred
- Parallelization via TBB — be mindful of shared state

## Key Entry Points

- App startup: `src/OrcaSlicer.cpp`
- Slicing pipeline: `src/libslic3r/Print.cpp`
- All print/printer/material settings: `src/libslic3r/PrintConfig.cpp`
- GUI: `src/slic3r/GUI/`
- Core algorithms: `src/libslic3r/` (GCode/, Fill/, Support/, Geometry/, Format/, Arachne/)
- Printer profiles: `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`

## Critical Constraints

- **Backward compatibility required** for .3mf project files and printer profiles
- **Cross-platform** — all changes must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Profile/format changes need version migration handling
- Dependencies built separately in `deps/build/`, then linked to main app

## Build Policy

**CRITICAL**: The agent must NEVER attempt to build the project. Only the user can run builds.
- Agent role: Make code changes only
- User role: Review changes, run builds, and test
- This applies to all build commands: cmake, xcodebuild, ninja, build scripts, etc.
- Agent should complete code changes and mark todos as done, then inform user that changes are ready for build

## Code review focus areas

- Changes must not cause regressions in existing functionality, defaults, profiles, or project compatibility.
- Features gated by options must not affect existing behavior when those options are disabled.
- Changes should follow the existing code style and architecture. Architectural changes should be justified in code comments and the PR description.
- Add helper functions or utilities only when existing code cannot reasonably be reused. Avoid duplication.
- Keep code concise and clear. Manually simplify AI generated bloated codes before review.
- Include targeted tests or documented verification for behavior changes, especially in slicing logic, profiles, formats, and GUI defaults.
